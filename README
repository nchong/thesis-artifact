Scalable Verification Techniques for Data-Parallel Programs
===========================================================

We give code for each of the figures appearing in the thesis. These are either
Boogie, CUDA or OpenCL applications. The code for each figure is found in its
matching directory.

Prerequisites
=============

The CUDA application (fig 2.2) requires a platform with the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.
The OpenCL application (fig 2.3 and 2.4) requires a platform with an OpenCL
implementation. The Houdini example (fig 3.3) requires a local install of
Boogie. All other examples can run using the rise4fun web interfaces for
Boogie or GPUVerify.
