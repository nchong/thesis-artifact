SUMMARY

This figure shows a simple CUDA application. 

FILES

* stencil-app.cu

As given in Figure 2.2, this gives the CUDA kernel and corresponding host code.
One notable simplification of this figure is that we did not include any error
checking.

* stencil.cu

This wraps stencil-app with an appropriate main function, calling hostStencil
with the input [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] with radius 1 and printing the output, which
should be [1,3,6,9,12,15,18,13].

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Compile stencil.cu with nvcc.

  $ nvcc -o stencil stencil.cu

2. Run the application and verify the output.

  $ ./stencil
  A = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
  A = [ 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 13 ]
