SUMMARY

This figure shows a simple OpenCL application. It mirrors the CUDA application
given in Figure 2.2.

FILES

* stencil.cl

As given in Figure 2.3, this gives the OpenCL kernel.

* stencil-host.cl

As given in Figure 2.4, this gives the host code. One notable simplification of
this figure is that we did not include any error checking.

* stencil.cpp

This wraps stencil-host with an appropriate main function, calling hostStencil
with the input [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] with radius 1 and printing the output, which
should be [1,3,6,9,12,15,18,13].

INSTRUCTIONS

Assuming that you have installed the OpenCL header and libraries in
$(OPENCL_HOME):

1. Compile stencil.cpp with a C++ compiler.

  $ clang++ -o stencil stencil.cpp -I $(OPENCL_HOME)/include \
                                   -L$(OPENCL_HOME)/lib64 \
                                   -L$(OPENCL_HOME)/lib -lOpenCL

Alternatively, on Mac:

  $ clang++ -o stencil stencil.cpp -framework OpenCL

2. Run the application and verify the output.

  $ ./stencil
  A = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
  A = [ 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 13 ]
