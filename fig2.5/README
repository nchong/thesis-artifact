SUMMARY

This figure shows a two simple kernel fragments exhibiting barrier divergence.

FILES

* a.cu

As given in Figure 2.5(a) as a CUDA kernel.

* b.cl

As given in Figure 2.5(b) as an OpenCL kernel.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy and paste each kernel into the rise4fun GPUVerify web interface.

  a.cu should be used with the CUDA frontend:
  http://rise4fun.com/gpuverify-cuda

  b.cl should be used with the OpenCL frontend
  http://rise4fun.com/gpuverify-opencl

In both cases we expect a barrier divergence error to be reported.
