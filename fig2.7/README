SUMMARY

This figure shows a racy kernel and includes a fix by including a barrier.

FILES

* nbor.cl

As given in Figure 2.7 in an OpenCL kernel with an additional #define for
including a fix.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy and paste the kernel into the rise4fun web interface.

  k.cl should be used with the OpenCL frontend
  http://rise4fun.com/gpuverify-opencl

We expect a data race error to be reported.

2. Edit the kernel to include fix by #define-ing APPLY_FIX or removing the
#ifdef condition around the barrier. Now we expect the kernel to pass.
