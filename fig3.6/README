SUMMARY

This figure shows a simple CUDA kernel that requires invariants.

FILES

* saxpy-slice.cu

As given in Figure 3.6 with additional invariants required to ensure that the
access pattern invariants are inductive.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy and paste the kernel into the rise4fun web interface.

  saxpy-slice.cu should be used with the CUDA frontend
  http://rise4fun.com/gpuverify-cuda

We expect the kernel to pass.

2. If you have access to a local install of GPUVerify you can turn off invariant
generation and only rely on the supplied annotations.

  $ GPUVerify.py --gridDim=[1] --blockDim=[4] --no-infer saxpy-slice.cu
